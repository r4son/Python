# Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

# Machine Learning
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on models and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence

# Deep Learning
Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
